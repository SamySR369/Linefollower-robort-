# Line Follower Robot using Arduino Uno & L298N

This project is a **Line Follower Robot** built with Arduino Uno, L298N Motor Driver, 4 DC motors, and 2 IR sensors.  
The robot follows a black line on a white surface by continuously adjusting its path based on IR sensor inputs.

## üöÄ Features
- Uses **Arduino Uno** for control.
- **L298N Motor Driver** to drive 4 DC motors.
- **IR Sensors** for line detection.
- Forward, Left, Right, and Stop functionalities.
- Simple and efficient algorithm for smooth line following.

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Required
- Arduino Uno
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- 4x DC Motors
- 2x IR Sensors
- Jumper Wires & Power Supply

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code
The Arduino sketch is included in `LineFollower.ino`.  

## üîß How it Works
- IR sensors detect whether the surface is black or white.
- Based on sensor values, the Arduino adjusts motor directions.
- Robot follows the path automatically.
